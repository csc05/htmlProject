<h1>Description</h1>
<p>There are three types of gamebooks.<br> The first is the branching-plot novel, which require the reader to make choices but are
    otherwise like a regular novel. These Gamebooks are sometimes informally called choose your own adventure books or
    CYOA which is the name of the well known Choose Your Own Adventure series originally published by Bantam Books.<br> The
    second type is the Solitaire adventure (an example of this is the Tunnels and Trolls series of gamebooks), which combines
    the branching-plot novel with the rules of a role-playing game, allowing the game to be played without a Gamemaster but
    may require the purchase of separate manuals.<br> The third type is the Adventure gamebook (examples of these are the
    Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf series of gamebooks), which combines the branching-plot novel with a simple role-playing
    system unique to the book (or series).</p>
