<h1>What is a gamebook?</h1>
<p>A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making <strong>choices</strong>. The <i>narrative
    branches</i> along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Production of new gamebooks
    in the West <sub>decreased</sub> dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from <sup>print based media.</sup></p>
