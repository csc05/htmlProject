This project provides a small report on data protection services, which will have the user create an account with a secure password.
If the password is not secure enough, that being if it is not up to a suitable length, or doesnâ€™t have a mix of special characters, it will be told to change or add to it or be given an example for a new password by clicking the generate button.
When the user has created a password, they can re-enter it into the application when signing in to see if it is correct.
If the username and password are correct, they will be taken to a form that provides information to the user of the importance of anti-malware.
