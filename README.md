This project provides a small report on data protection services, which will have the user create an account with a secure password.
If the password is not secure enough, that being if it is not up to a suitable length, or doesn’t have a mix of special characters, it will be told to change or add to it or be given an example for a new password by clicking the generate button.
When the user has created a password, they can re-enter it into the application when signing in to see if it is correct.
If the username and password are correct, they will be taken to a form that provides information to the user of the importance of anti-malware. 

Instructions: If the user is in charge or in possession of the website and the database, then the user will have the ability to link their JSON file-based database.
That will allow the user to make use of the website’s services, such as accessing data, decrypting data, and that way, everything is secure, and only available to authorised people.
After registering, there is media and content, as well as a button to update the database, which will download a new version of the JSON file with the addition of the newly signed up user.
The user can use that file and consider it as the new up to date database.
